Oh, hello!

I am a simple starter set for building an application with React on the front end, and Express/Sequelize on the backend!

To start using me, here's what you'll have to do:

* Choose a name for your app!
* `createdb YOUR_APP_NAME`
* In `server/db.js`, swap out the 'YOUR_DB' bit with your actual db name
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

The start script runs webpack in watch mode, and nodemon, so any changes you make to the client or server directories should cause webpack to rebuild and the server to restart, respectively. Note that you may need to wait a moment for the webpack build to complete - if you refresh the page too soon, you may not see your changes.
